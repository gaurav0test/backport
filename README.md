# Backport Bot

Backport Bot is a [JavaScript GitHub Action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-actions#javascript-actions) to backport a pull request by simply adding a label to it.

It can backport [rebased and merged](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull requests with a single commit and [squashed and merged](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull requests. It thus integrates well with [Autosquash](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/autosquash).

This version even works on forked repositories!

## Usage

1. :electric_plug: Add this [.github/workflows/backport.yml](.github/workflows/backport.yml) to your repository.
2. :guardsman: Create a user for the bot. Set this username in backport.yml
3. :scissors: With this user, fork your repository.
4. :key: Generate a personal access token with this user.
5. :unlock: Setup this personal access token as bot_token in backport.yml.
6. :speech_balloon: Let's say you want to backport a pull request on a branch named `production`. Then label it with `backport production`. (See [how to create labels](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-label/).)
7. :sparkles: That's it! When the pull request gets merged, another pull request will be opened, backporting the commit to the `production` branch. If the pull request cannot be backported, a comment explaining why will automatically be posted.

_Note:_ multiple backport labels can be added. For example, if a pull request has the labels `backport staging` and `backport production` it will be backported to both branches: `staging` and `production`.

## Security Implications

The token provided to backport.yml will be visible to anyone with access to your repo. If your repo
is public, this means everyone. This will allow anyone to impersonate
your bot account and use it to do anything your bot account can do. It is very important to give
your bot token the "public_repo" access only, and for your bot account not to be used for anything else.
Your bot account should not have any permissions that a public github user does not have.
